## Existing Grav site

It is possible to install just the theme, but page content will need to reference the [Halcyon theme](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-halcyon)'s supported templates.  It is strongly advised to at least install the Halcyon Skeleton package to see the theme's capabilities in action.

To install  **just** the theme:

```
$ bin/gpm install halcyon
```
